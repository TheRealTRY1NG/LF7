## 1. Individual learning goals
Since most problems occure automatically by themselves we would like to focus more and learning how to ideate possible solutions and approach them afterwards. Therefore we would also like to learn how to setup and use a Raspberry Pi in combination with smaller modules e.g. like sensors for touch or light.

## 2. DIY problem definition (5WH)

### 2.1. What is the key issue you are trying to address and why is it important?

The key issue being addressed is the lack of a seamless, adaptive, and truly personalized
smart home experience. While current systems allow automation, they typically rely on static
schedules or simple triggers, requiring significant user input. This product aims to introduce
AI-driven automation that can intelligently adjust tasks based on users’ moods, behaviors,
and preferences, offering a more intuitive and user-friendly home experience.
This is important because modern lifestyles demand convenience and efficiency. As people
spend more time at home and technology becomes more integrated into daily life, there’s a
need for smarter, more responsive systems that do not require constant manual
adjustments. Enhancing the smart home experience can improve comfort, security, and
energy efficiency.

### 2.2. Who is it a problem for?

This is a problem for individuals and families who use or are interested in using smart home
devices but find current systems cumbersome or limited. This includes tech-savvy users who
crave deeper personalization and automation, as well as busy professionals, elderly people,
or those with accessibility needs who benefit from homes that can automatically adapt to
their routines.
It also impacts those who are environmentally conscious and looking to reduce energy
consumption without sacrificing comfort.

### 2.3. What social/cultural factors shape this problem?

The rising demand for convenience, personalization, and energy efficiency in homes shapes
this problem. With the growing adoption of smart home technology, there’s an expectation for
devices to be intuitive and tailored to individual lifestyles. Moreover, as work-from-home
setups become more common, the home environment plays a bigger role in productivity,
comfort, and well-being.
Additionally, concerns over privacy and data security influence how people interact with
smart home systems. Trust in AI handling personal data, including mood detection, is a
significant cultural factor, requiring transparent design to ensure user confidence.

### 2.4. What evidence do you have that this is worth the investment?

- **Market Growth:** The smart home automation market is booming. According to
research, the global smart home market is expected to reach $135.3 billion by 2025,
driven by increasing demand for convenience, security, and energy efficiency.
- **Consumer Trends:** Surveys show that consumers are looking for more personalized
and advanced automation systems that make their lives easier. AI-powered
personalization and automation are often listed as desirable features in smart homes.
- **Behavioral Evidence:** User data from existing smart home products indicates a
demand for systems that can automatically adjust based on habits and preferences,
suggesting that more sophisticated automation would attract a broader audience.

### 2.5. Can you think of this problem in a different way? Can you reframe it?

This problem can be reframed as one of anticipatory design rather than just automation.
Instead of thinking about smart homes that simply respond to commands, the focus could
shift toward homes that anticipate the user’s needs before they’re even aware of them. By
reframing the problem in terms of proactive and predictive living environments, it shifts from
reactive automation to creating a living space that truly enhances quality of life by
preemptively adapting to the user’s state and environment.

#### What if we had no monetary/time constraints?

We could develop cutting-edge AI that not only learns from patterns but also uses biometric
inputs like facial expressions or voice tone to detect the user’s emotional state. This would
allow the system to preemptively adjust the environment, offering suggestions for optimal
comfort. Advanced integration would allow it to work universally across all smart home
brands, further enhancing user experience. It might also feature VR or AR control for
immersive management of home automation.

#### What other crazy idea jumps in our mind?

The product could evolve to predict and suggest lifestyle improvements, such as
recommending health tips, adjusting environments for better sleep or productivity, or
